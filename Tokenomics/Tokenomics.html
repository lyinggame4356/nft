               <p>Turtle Tribe will be releasing a token called $TRIBLING and this token will be the main governance token of the Turtle Tribe game as well as the future projects we will be releasing! The only ways to get those tokens at the beginning is through staking our NFTs and an airdrop that will be given to people who minted before 20% of our NFT supply were minted! In addition, once we release our game people can buy these tokens through our IDO or presale, or buy them through the DEX we will be releasing on! The token will have multiple use cases and that will lead to its price constantly rising as well as allow the Turtle Tribe community to be eternal! </p>

                <h1 style="color: rgb(29, 204, 204);" class="py-4"><i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> Distribution</h1>
                <p>$TRIBLING will have a total supply of 1 million and 75% of the supply will be locked in a reward pool to then be earned through staking, and 15% will be airdropped to people who minted a TT NFT before 20% of our NFT supply was minted! You might be thinking that is only 90%, where is the remaining 10%? The remaining 10% will be distributed on DEX's or decentralized exchanges right before our game will launch. In other words the only way to receive our tokens is to own a Turtle Tribe NFT and stake it or to have minted a Turtle Tribe NFT before 20% of the supply was minted. In addition, after the staking period is over users will be able to stake their $TRIBLING to earn even more $TRIBLING to then be used in our game launch! However our token will not be tradeable until we host our IDO and the game is launched that way the value of the coin is preserved and once the game launches the high demand would cause the token price to skyrocket!</p>

               <p>$TRIBLING will have multiple use cases which will cause the price to stay rising and will allow our community to be able to earn passive income for a long period of time. The first use for our token is the NFT marketplace in our game! Users who play our game have the option to mint a loot box (this is optional and can help you earn even more money) which can give them rare loot to use in our game! Secondly, to play the special game modes and participate in our special events which offer amazing prizes users must put a bit of $TRIBLING to enter! There will be a free mode where holders can use their NFT to play for free but the greater rewards are found in these fun and awesome modes and challenges! Besides, holders of a Turtle Tribe NFT will be able to stake their NFTs and tokenswhich means that people who join our project early or at least before the game launches can play all these special modes and join the competitions at no additional costs!
