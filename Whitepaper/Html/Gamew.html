              <h1>What Will Our Game be?</h1>
              <br>
              <p class="fs-4">Our game, TurtleCove, will essentially be that of a play to earn MMOG featuring a wide variety of game modes. From <a href="">Dungeon crawler</a> to <a href="">Skirmish</a> and a lot more! Players will for the most part be able to login with their metamask wallets on the Polygon Network, to then access their in-game accounts. The vision of the game is to give players the opportunity to earn money that will be given out in $TRIBLING, our governace currency, while having fun with friends and randoms! It also provides more use cases for our coin $TRIBLING for better long term support! 
                 <br> <br> Accessibility is a key feature in the game. It'll be made so all supporters of TurtleCove have the opportunity to play. More information is provided as you scroll throughout this page on our game mechanics and how everything will work.
                  Aside from that, TurtleCove will contain in game utilities that can be obtained through <a href=""> The Coral Reef </a> and the <a href="">Marketplace</a>. These gadgets can range from weapons and armor, to cosmetics and <a href="">souvenirs</a>. These utilities however, don't necessarily provide competitive advantages in PvP, otherwise it would break the game. Instead it will bring forth greater potential rewards and more ways to earn from with the use of our <a href="">Ranking System.</a> In addition, the higher rarity weapons you have the stronger you are in PvE!
                   We wish to build a sustainable game around the topic of the endangered turtles and sea life in general to spread awareness and provide support, while helping our community earn a passive source of income!</p>

                <h1>What is Needed to Get Access to TurtleCove?</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Essentially, all holders of TurtleTribe NFTs will have access to the MMOG play to earn game.
                   They will be able to play a bunch of the game modes that we offer to start earning, typically paying an entrance fee that will vary between game modes and rankings.
                    Non TurtleTribe NFT holders on the other hand will get restricted to one game mode <a href=""> Free Play</a>. In addition, for people who don't want to play in the competetive PvP games because they are scared they will lose their money, there is a <a href="">Dungeon</a> game which is PvE as well as a weekly competetition with no entrance fee and everyone wins some money.

                <h1>What will be used to develop TurtleCove?</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Unreal Engine will be the game engine we use, along with the Etherlinker plugin which for the most part allows Unreal Engine to interact with solidity smart contracts. With this approach, we will have the ability to link the game to the Ethereum Blockchain. Check out our YouTube channel where our devs will constantly be adding dev logs and updates on the game progress!

                <h1>Dungeon Crawler</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">In Turtle Cove, there will be a game mode called Dungeons. This game mode can only be played once a day and is strictly for NFT owners. In this game mode, players pay a 
                  starting entrance fee and then enter a dungeon filled with enemies. The player will have to fight a wave of enemies either with the starter weapon or any weapon they have bought from the
                   marketplace and then after defeating the enemy they will advance to the boss battle and if they succeed in defeating the boss players will earn double what they initially invested.
                    After you have the option to either continue and double their rewards if they beat the next wave of enemies and the boss, however, if at any point in time they died they will lose
                     all the money invested and will have to wait for the next day to try again! The difficulty will steadily increase as you progress through the dungeon! In addition, if players succcees in defeating five bosses they will receive
                    a small amount of sehlls that can be used in <a href="">The Coral Reef</a> to purchase mythical loot boxes!</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="py-5">
              <div class="offset-md-2">
                <h1>Skirmish</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">This game mode will be similar to a battle royale where 100 players will be deployed to an arena and each player will 
                  have to pay an entrance fee of 10$ players will then find weapons lying on the ground of all rarities and will have to fight each other until there is 
                  one player left and then the players who placed top 3 would receive rewards and it is distributed as follows: First place will receive 250$, second place 
                  will receive 150$ and third place will receive 100$. Then half of the remaining amount which is 125 will be burned forever and the other half will go to the 
                  weekly event where it will be distributed to all holders of Turtle Tribe NFTâ€™s during a fun event!</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="py-5">
            <div class="offset-md-2">
              <h1>Ranked Play</h1>
              <br>
              <p class="fs-4">Ranked play is a pvp game mode that uses the ranking system in which players can go in solos, duos or squads, and battle against others in a tournament based system of 3 rounds where the winners take 90% of the total entrance 
                fee paid by all players, 5% will be burnt, 3% will go to devs and 2% will go to charity.</p>
            </div>
            </div>
            <div class="py-5">
            <div class="offset-md-2">
              <h1>Weekly Play</h1>
              <br>
              <p class="fs-4">Weekly play is a game mode made so that all holders of Turtle Tribe NFTs can earn without having to pay an entrance fee! This is made so that players who don't thin they are skilled at PvP or PvE can also earn a guaranteed reward without having to worry about losing their money!
                As the name suggests this mode will be held once a week and the rewards you recive will be determined by the NFT that you hold, for example a common Turtle Tribe NFT will yield less rewards than a more rare NFT this is to further increase the value of our rare NFTs!</p>
            </div>
            </div>
            <div class="py-5">
              <div class="offset-md-2">
                <h1>Free Play</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">This will be a game mode where everyone regardless of if they own a Turtle Tribe NFT, can play however the rewards are limited and a certain level must be reached before players can withdraw the amount they earned. This will be a team deathmatch mode
                  and we implemented it so that people in our community who did not get the chance to receive a Turtlr Tribe NFT can still be part of our amazing game!
                </p>
              </div>

                <h1>The Coral Reef</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">The Coral Reef, found in the warm tropical waters of TurtleCove, is a marketplace where players can exchange their shells that they earned by beating five bosses in the <a href="">Dungeon</a>
                  upon using the shells in The Coral Reef you will be rewarded by a lootbox where you have the chance to earn one of the mythical weapons of "The Lost Weapons Collection" these are weapon NFT's that can 
                  only be earned through the Coral Reef and then can be used in our various game modes and owning one of these weapons will allow you to earn more money as well as many other advantages or it can be sold 
                  on the marketplace however because of the difficulty in aquiring these they will have a higher value than every other weapon!</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="py-5">
              <div class="offset-md-2">
                <h1>Marketplace</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">In the marketplace there will be multiple sections. First, a character section where holders of a TT NFT can sell it for $TRIBLING or buy some. Secondly, a utility tab here players can mint a lootbox for a we, 
                  armor, souvenir, or boats and then use them in our various game modes, or users can re-sell their NFT's in one of the utility sub-tabs such as the weapons tab, armor tab, etc. It is advised that all Turtle Tribe NFT's will be sold and 
                bought here once the game has been released. However, it is optional for people to list their NFT's on marketplaces such as Opensea</p>

                <h1>Ranking System</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">TurtleCove's ranking system works in a way where every in game NFT utilities will yield a certain ranking score. Depending on your total ranking score, players will be put in certain leagues (bronze, silver, gold, etc..) which will identify what kind of matches they'll be able to join.
                   The higher the match's league, the higher the rewards earned by the players will be in pvp, with a slightly bigger entrance fee. Players of a higher ranking will still have the ability to go in matches of a lower ranking, but will earn what the rank of that match offers and pay its entrance fee.
                    For instance, if you are in the gold rank, you could play in the silver or bronze matches, while paying the entrance fee of the silver or bronze matches, and earn its rewards. PvP gamemodes like <a href="">Ranked Play</a> and <a href="">Skirmish</a> will use this mechanism to prevent the game from becoming a pay to win!</p>

                <h1>Souvenirs and Boats</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Souvenirs will give players PvE bonuses and boosts to increase their likelihood of success; such as more health, speed, or even strength! They can be attained through the marketplace, The Coral Reef, or potentially as an in game prize. Boats on the other hand will be used for other game modes and features still to come. More information on them will be given out at a later stage of the game. </p>

                <h1>Rarity</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">TurtleCove NFTs such as the weapons, armor, souvenirs, etc. will be distributed into different rarities, common, rare, unique and Legendary. The chances for pulling NFTs of certain rarities from a lootbox will be as follows: <br>
                Common: 70% <br> Rare: 20% <br> Extravagant: 8% <br> Legendary: 2% <br> 
              The higher the rarity, the greater the ranking score. Meaning the more in game opporunities and rewards for PvP. For PvE, Higher rarities will provide better boosts and bonuses. Last but not least, TurtleCove NFTs with a legendary rarity will allow players to join matches of a league lower than the one they are currently on for free, without paying any entrance fees and still earn rewards. In addition,
            people who own one of the rare Turtle Tribe NFT's won't have to pay an entrance fee for any game mode!</p>
